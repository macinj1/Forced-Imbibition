# Multiphase CFD modeling of front propagation: Forced-Imbibition

The reposity contains an OpenFOAM implementation to study a 3D liquid-gas front propagation in a modulated Hele-Shaw cell. 
We modulated the Hele-Shaw cell by placing a squared box at the center of bottom wall, which partially fills the gap. 
We study the morphological differences between imbibition (left figure) and drainage (right figure) for a wide range of capillary numbers by changing the incoming fluid while keeping the same gas in the chamber.

## OpenFOAM implementation 

The OpenFOAM implementation uses **interFoam**. We change the fluids properties in the file **alpha.water.orig** and run the case by 
```sh
sh run_case.sh
```
Depending on the viscosity ration between the liquid-gas used, the simulation could results in a significant amount of time. The contact angle between the liquid and the walls is also studied. 
The results are presented in the following [article](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.6.084305). 

The following video shows a simulation using oil-air pair.
